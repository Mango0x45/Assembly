Overview
========
This is just a repository where I fle- I mean show off my assembly programs. I'm still learning, and it is a very hard language compared to the others, so any pointers and suggestions if anyone bothers to check out the code would be much appreciated. I am not 100% how assembly works with it's different flavors/dialects/whatever they're called, but the assembly used here I *believe* is called "NASM Linux64 Assembly"
